Wendy Wu has a one track mind, and that track leads directly to the title of homecoming queen – no unscheduled stops, and no unnecessary detours. When a mysterious Chinese monk named Shen arrives to mold Wendy into a fearless kung fu warrior, however, her royal aspirations suddenly jump the track as she desperately attempts to juggle her boyfriend, her homework, and of course, the fierce competition to become homecoming queen. Now, as Wendy begins to train her mind, body, and spirit in the ancient tradition of the martial arts and her inner warrior gradually begins to emerge, the girl who once obsessed over popularity finally begins to put that popularity into perspective as she gradually realizes what truly matters in life. ×",https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/1/6/5016-wendy-wu-homecoming-warrior-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1f8c0110e0,https://letterboxd.com/film/wendy-wu-homecoming-warrior/
